##  Features

- STM32F103C8T6 (ARM Cortex-M3)
- USB-powered (5V input with onboard 3.3V regulator)
- SWD header for programming/debugging
- BOOT0 button
- GPIO pin headers for easy interfacing
- Compact 2-layer PCB design
- Designed using KiCad



## Getting Started

1. Download the Gerber files and place an order with your preferred PCB manufacturer (lion circuits)
2. Solder the components as per the schematic and BOM.
3. Upload firmware using ST-Link v2 via the SWD header or using a USB-UART adapter with the bootloader.
4. Start developing your embedded project!
